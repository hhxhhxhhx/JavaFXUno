Note: This changelog file was created when version 1.3.1 was finished. No update logs for previous versions.

6.2.0 4/11
Players now able to select who to swap hands with when using a 7. 

6.1.0 4/11
Updated look for selecting whether to play a card you just drew.
Updated look for selecting whether you want to stack or not.
Updated animation for +2 and +4 to show the total stacked number of cards as well. 

6.0.0 4/10
Added new stacking feature!
Still need to update the look for clicking a card to stack with. 

5.1.0 4/9 (Really should be 6.0 for the effort)
Fixed issue with clients leaving and not being replaced and messing up the rest of the game. 
Fixed issue with clients receiving someone else's hand
Completely remade most animations so they aren't just a bigger card popping up
Bots now act more human with more strategic artificial delays. 
	An issue right now is that since the previous turn's actions are not recorded, if player 1 played a skip, player
		3 then drew a card and didn't play, a bot at player 4's position will pause because they thought someone
		before it played a skip. 
New animations needed for Redistribute cards, Randomly draw cards, and the 7. 

5.0.0 4/9
Client disconnecting will now instantly replace the client with a bot. :D
When there are no human players left, stop the game. 
Completely unnecessary to check if exception is socket connection error: when client closes stage, 
	send message to server saying "this client dc" and server will close their connections to that
	client, and Game will take care of replacing it with a bot player

4.1.0 4/9
Minor tweaks in GameGUI to make players drawing in the upper left corner have the card rotated at the correct angle.
Changed how Exceptions are handled throughout the program --> lots of methods now simply throw an exception
	instead of handling it by themselves. Eventually, the UnoGame class will receive what the exception is. 
	Then, the UnoGame will end the infinite loop and exit. 
Future goal is to determine if the exception is a socket connection error. If it is, then it's because someone disconnected
	In this case, 

4.0.0 4/9
Fixed bug with bot so that it correctly determines who is the next player.
Bot now has more logic built in so it's less stupid.
Putting the previous version at 3.0.0 is really undercutting what's been done, so we're bumping this one.

3.0.0 4/8
There we have it. Bots!
Artificial delay if last card had some sort of animation with it so we only see 1 animation at a time lol.
Need to tweak how it chooses a color for wild cards tomorrow, should be easy. 

2.5.0 4/8
Ready for full update to support bots.
Fixed critical bug in UnoGameGUI that made played cards not at the center of the pane. 

2.4.1 4/8
Arraylists for humans are no more! Hashtables rule!

2.4.0 4/7
Upcoming for 3.0: Code overhaul for UnoServer.java for upcoming support for bots. Server should no longer be
	requesting for a certain client to answer; UnoGame should be asking Server to request client for answer,
		OR, UnoGame should be calling a bot to make a move. 
	This means that clients won't necessarily be in the same index in the Server arraylist of clients as the game turn.

Added new card: When played, each player, on average, will draw 3 cards. There is no minimum or maximum, but that
	the total number of cards drawn by all players is equal to 3 * total number of players. 
New methods in Util and UnoCard to shorten code in UnoGame and UnoGameGUI even more.

2.3.1 4/7
Changed how redistribute redistributes cards: the person who played it will receive the least cards

2.3.0 4/6
Players are no longer able to click on their cards when it's not their turn. This bug was due to NOT updating
	every player's hand after each turn, because the original thought process is that if they didn't gain
	or lose a card, they shouldn't need to update. 
Additionally, to prevent people from clicking multiple times during their turn to try to break the game,
	after a player clicks on the card (if wild, after selecting color), their own cursor is disabled.
Action handlers for the cards in your hand now also check if cursor is enabled before doing their actions.
New server launcher look

2.2.0 4/6
Added new feature that can be enabled. If enabled, playing a 7 now randomly swaps your cards with someone else.
Likewise with 0, if it is your last card, you will win.
A bug that I know is present: Change x and y difference if you're swapping with someone with angle between 
	critical top left and critical top right

2.1.0 4/5
Added new feature that can be enabled. If enabled, playing a 0 now rotates everyone's cards.
However, if it is your last card, you will win and no rotations will occur.

2.0.1 4/5
Now prevents people from clicking in other places when a popup window appears. This would prevent dion from
	messing up my program intentionally. 

2.0.0 4/5
Huge amount of code rewritten to optimize how new special effects cards can be coded in. 
Animation 'should' be smoother, especially with card drawing. (I spent a lot of time fine-tuning them)

1.4.5 4/4
Renamed Redistribute to Socialism because "Redistribute" contains "Red"
Bug fixes regarding whether a card is compatible with the previously played card. These came from
	the addition of the Socialism since Socialism by itself doesn't change the color nor the value of the previous card
ty joshua for some extra images

1.4.4 4/4
New type of card: Redistribute. Redistributes everyone the same (almost the same if not perfectly divisible) number of cards
	The cards are randomly distributed. 
Took about 10 min of debugging because didn't copy and paste a code to another place because bad code.
Took about 20 more min of debugging because messed up variable names in a nested for loop

1.4.3 4/4
Prevented another way of spamming the draw button. 
Ready to do large code overhaul for implementation of new mechanics

1.4.2 4/4
Added special effects when you play a special card
Code Cleanup

1.4.1 4/4
Changed how drawing a card that you would now be able to play would be animated. 
It used to be a popup to select "yes" or "no", if you click no, then the drawing card animation would play.
Now, the drawing card animation is shown, then the popup appears. If you click no, nothing happens. If you
	click yes, the playing a card animation happens.

1.4 4/4
Now able to select whether to enable or disable (being able to draw a card only if you can't play anything)

1.3.2 4/4
When you close the "do you want to play this card you just drew" window, it defaults to you saying "no"
Fixed issue with people spamming the "Draw" button to keep drawing cards during their turn
Fixed issue with animation where a card drawing animation is played twice because of the original code for animation

1.3.1 4/4
When you draw a card that can be playable, the user is asked if they want to play the card. 
When cards are drawn, they happen one at a time for aesthetic purposes. 
Lots of code is now really bad, because implementing animation of 1 card at a time now causes a lot of code to be called numerous
	times per turn.
